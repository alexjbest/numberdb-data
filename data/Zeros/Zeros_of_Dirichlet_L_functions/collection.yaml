Title: Zeros of Dirichlet L-series

Definition: >
  The list contains the first few imaginary parts of zeros of
  the first few Dirichlet L-functions on the critical line.
  
  
Comments:
- > 
  Let $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character.
  The associated L-function $\zeta(\chi,s)$ is the 
  meromorphic continuation of the Dirichlet series 
  $s \to \sum_{n=0}^\infty \chi(n) n^{-s}, \Re(s) > 0$.
  
- >
  Its so-called trivial zeros lie on the negative $x$-axis, which are
  therefore not listed.

  All known non-trivial zeros lie on the line $\Re s = 1/2$.
  If $\chi$ is real, their imaginary parts are symmetric about 0, 
  in which case we only list the positive ones.
